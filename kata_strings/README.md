Objective is to complete a recursive function reverse() that 
receives `word` as String and returns the same string in 
reverse order

<br />

## Rules

* reverse function should be executed only N times. N = length of the input string
* helper functions are not allowed
* changing the signature of the function is not allowed

<br />

## Examples

`reverse("hello world") = "dlrow olleh" (N = 11)`

`reverse("abcd") = "dcba" (N = 4)`

`reverse("12345") = "54321" (N = 5)`
